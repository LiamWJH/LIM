# `/docs` folder
## **Why does `/docs` exist?**
the `/docs` folder contains organized, and intuitive markdown files that will help you understand and use the language. It can also guide you briefly about the language internals.

## **How should `/docs` be used?**
the `/docs` should be used as the guidebook if you cannot contact me directly through discord. The `elite_knowledge_ball.md` should be used to understand internals. The `Examples.md` should be used to see examples to develop the idea of what this language is. The `Stdlib.md` should be used to know what functions are out there as a basis. The `Syntax.md` should be used to understand the language itself.

## **Can I contribute?**
YES! You can! And i encourage you to make our documentation better for the greater good! Make a pull-request when you can!
